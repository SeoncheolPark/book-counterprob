# Measures and Probability Measures

A probability measure $P$ is a function that assigns a probability to the allowable sets $\mathcal{F}$ and that satisfies certain conditions. Ideally, we would like $P$ to satisfiy $P(\Omega)=1$ and $P(\cup_{t}A_t)=\sum_{t}P(A_t)$ for every collection of disjoint sets $A_t$, even an uncountable collection. Unfortunately, this **uncountable additivity** requirement is too much to ask because it precludes the existence of a "uniform" probability measure $P$ on $\Omega=[0,1]$. To see this, note that for such a measure, each $\omega=\Omega$ has the same probability $p$, so if $P$ were uncountably additive, then $1=P(\Omega)=P([0,1])=\sum_{\Omega}p$. But this produces a contradiction because $\sum_{\Omega}p$ is $0$ if $p=0$ and $\infty$ if $p>0$. Therefore, uncountable additivity is too strong a condition to require. It turns out the strongest property of this type that we con impose is **countable additivity**.
