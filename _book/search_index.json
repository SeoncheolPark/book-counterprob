Its elements, denoted by \\(\\omega\\), will be interpreted as outcomes (results) of some experiment.

["3-2-field-and-sigma-field.html", "3.2 Field and sigma-field", " 3.2 Field and sigma-field Definition 2.1 (Field) The class \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) of subsets of \\(\\Omega\\) is called a field if it contains \\(\\Omega\\) and is closed under the formation of complements and finite unions, that is if: \\(\\Omega \\in \\mathcal{A}\\); \\(A \\in \\mathcal{A} \\Rightarrow A^c \\in \\mathcal{A}\\); \\(A_{1}, A_{2}\\in\\mathcal{A} \\Rightarrow A_{1} \\cup A_{2} \\in \\mathcal{A}\\). Proposition 2.1 (Definition of a field) The condition 3 of the definition of a field can be replaced by \\(A_{1}, A_{2} \\in \\mathcal{A} \\Rightarrow A_{1} \\cap A_{2} \\in \\mathcal{A}\\). That means, \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is closed under finite intersections. Proof. By de Morgan laws, \\((A_{1} \\cap A_{2})^{C} = A_{1}^{C} \\cup A_{2}^{C}\\) and \\((A_{1} \\cup A_{2})^{c} = A_{1}^{C} \\cap A_{2}^{C}\\). By the condition 2 of the definition of a field, we can get the desired result. Definition 2.2 (Semi-field) Let \\(\\Omega\\) be an arbitrary set. A non-empty class \\(\\mathcal{J}\\) of subsets of \\(\\Omega\\) is called a semi-field if \\(\\Omega = \\mathcal{J}, \\emptyset \\in \\mathcal{J}\\), \\(\\mathcal{J}\\) is closed under the formation of finite intersections, and the complement of any set in \\(\\mathcal{J}\\) is a finite sum of disjoint sets of \\(\\mathcal{J}\\). It is easy to see that any field of subsets of \\(\\Omega\\) is also a semi-field. However, the following simple examples show that the converse is not true. Example 2.2 (A class of events which is a semi-field but not a field) 1. Let \\(\\Omega=[-\\infty, \\infty)\\) and \\(\\mathcal{J}_{1}\\), contain \\(\\Omega\\), \\(\\{\\infty\\}\\) and all intervals of the type \\([a,b)\\) where \\(-\\infty &lt; a \\leq b \\leq \\infty\\). Then, \\(\\emptyset \\in \\mathcal{J}_{1}\\), \\(\\Omega \\in \\mathcal{J}_{1}\\), \\([a_{1}, b_{1}) \\cap [a_{2}, b_{2})=[a_{1} \\vee a_{2}, b_{1} \\wedge b_{2})\\in\\mathcal{J}_{1}\\), and \\([a,b)^{C}=[-\\infty, a)\\cup[b, \\infty)\\). So, \\(\\mathcal{J}_{1}\\), is a semi-field. Obviously \\(\\mathcal{J}_{1}\\) is not a field (Check 2.3). Take \\(\\Omega = \\mathbb{R}^{1}\\) and denote by \\(\\mathcal{J}_{2}\\) the class of all subsets of the form \\(A\\cap B\\) where \\(A\\) is closed and \\(B\\) is an open set in \\(\\Omega\\). Then again, \\(\\mathcal{J}_{2}\\) is a semi-field but not a field. Definition 2.3 (Sigma-field) The class \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) of subsets of \\(\\Omega\\) is called a \\(\\sigma\\)-field if it is a field and closed under the formation of countable unions, that is if: \\(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, \\in \\mathcal{F} \\Rightarrow \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty}A_{n} \\in \\mathcal{F}\\). Proposition 2.2 (Definition of a sigma-field) The condition 4 of the definition of a sigma-field can be replaced by \\(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, \\in \\mathcal{F} \\Rightarrow \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty}A_{n} \\in \\mathcal{F}\\). That means, \\(\\sigma\\)-field \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is closed under countable intersections because \\(\\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty}A_{n} = (\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty}A_{n}^{C})^{C}\\) and each \\(A_{n}^{C}\\) belongs to \\(\\mathcal{F}\\). Proof. By de Morgan lawsand condition 2 of the definition of a field, \\((\\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty}A_{n})^{C}=\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty}A_{n}^{C}\\in\\mathcal{F}\\) and \\((\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty}A_{n})^{C}=\\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty}A_{n}^{C}\\in\\mathcal{F}\\). So, we can change the condition 4. Usually, \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is the set of events (subsets of \\(\\Omega\\)) we are allowed to consider. Definition 2.4 (Random events (events)) The elements of any field of \\(\\sigma\\)-field are called random events (or simply, events). Example 2.3 (A class of events which is a field but not a sigma-field) Let \\(\\Omega = [0, \\infty)\\) and \\(\\mathcal{F}_{1}\\) be the class of all intervals of the type \\([a,b)\\) or \\([a,\\infty)\\), where \\(0 \\leq a &lt; b &lt; \\infty\\). Let \\(\\mathcal{F}_{2}\\) be the class of all finite sums of intervals of \\(\\mathcal{F}_{1}\\). Then \\(\\mathcal{F}_{1}\\) is not a field, and \\(\\mathcal{F}_{2}\\) is a field but not a \\(\\sigma\\)-field. Take arbitrary numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), \\(0&lt;a&lt;b&lt;\\infty\\). Then \\(A=[a,b)\\in \\mathcal{F}_{1}\\). However, \\(A^{C} = [0, a) \\cup [b, \\infty)\\neq \\mathcal{F}_{1}\\) and thus \\(\\mathcal{F}_{1}\\) is not a field. It is easy to see that the finite union of finite sums of intervals (of \\(\\mathcal{F}_{1}\\)) is again a sum of intervals; the complement of a finite sum of intervals is also a sum of intervals. This means that \\(\\mathcal{F}_{2}\\) is a field. However, \\(\\mathcal{F}_{2}\\) is not a \\(\\sigma\\)-field because, for example, the set \\(A_{n} =[0,\\frac{1}{n})\\in\\mathcal{F}_{1}\\) for each \\(n=1,2,\\ldots,\\) and the intersection \\(\\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty}A_{n} =\\{0\\}\\) does not belong to \\(\\mathcal{F}_{1}\\). Let us look at two additional cases. Let \\(\\Omega = \\mathbb{R}^{1}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) be the class of all finite sums of intervals of the type $(-, a], \\((b,c]\\) and \\((d,\\infty)\\). Then \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is a field. But the intersection \\(\\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty}(b-\\frac{1}{n}, c]\\) is equal to \\([b,c]\\) which does not belong to \\(\\mathcal{F}\\). Hence, the field \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is not a \\(\\sigma\\)-field. Let \\(\\Omega\\) be any infinite set and \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) the collection of all subsets \\(A\\in \\Omega\\) such that either \\(A\\) or \\(A^{c}\\) is finite. Then it is easy to see that \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is a field but not a \\(\\sigma\\)-field. Example 2.4 (A class of events can be closed under finite unions and finite intersections but not under complements) Let \\(\\Omega = \\mathbb{R}\\) and the class \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) consist of intervals of the type \\((x,\\infty)\\), \\(x\\in\\Omega\\). Then using the notations \\(u = x\\wedge y:= \\min\\{x,y\\}\\) and \\(v=x\\vee y:=\\max \\{x,y\\}\\) we have: \\[(x,\\infty) \\cup (y,\\infty) = (u,\\infty)\\in\\mathcal{A}\\] \\[(x,\\infty) \\cap (y,\\infty) = (v,\\infty)\\in\\mathcal{A}.\\] However, \\((x,\\infty)^{C} = (-\\infty, x]\\notin\\mathcal{A}\\). Remark. Because any field or \\(\\sigma\\)-field \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is nonempty, it contains a set \\(A\\), and therefore \\(A^{C}\\). Consequently, any field or \\(\\sigma\\)-field contains \\(\\Omega = A \\cup A^{C}\\) and \\(\\emptyset = \\Omega^{C}\\). A \\(\\sigma\\)-field is more restrictive than a field. Because we want to be able to consider countable unions, we require the allowable sets \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) to be a \\(\\sigma\\)-field. Therefore, it is understood in probability theory and throughout the remainder we are allowed to consider only the events belonging to the \\(\\sigma\\)-field \\(\\mathcal{F}\\). We will see that fields also play an important role in probability because a common technique is first to define a probability measure on a field and then extend it to a \\(\\sigma\\)-field. Definition 2.5 (D-system) A system \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) of subsets of a given set \\(\\Omega\\) is called a D-system (Dynkin system) in \\(\\Omega\\) if the following three conditions hold: \\(\\Omega \\in \\mathcal{D}\\); \\(A,B\\in \\mathcal{D}\\) and \\(A\\subset B \\Rightarrow B\\backslash A\\in\\mathcal{D}\\); \\(A_{n}\\in \\mathcal{D}, n=1,2,\\ldots .\\) and \\(A_{1} \\subset A_{2} \\subset \\ldots \\Rightarrow \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty}A_{n} \\in \\mathcal{D}\\). It is obvious that every \\(\\sigma\\)-field is a D-system, but the converse may not be true. Example 2.5 (Every sigma-field of events is a D-system, but the converse does not always hold) Take \\(\\Omega = \\{\\omega_{1}, \\omega_{2}, \\ldots, \\omega_{2n}\\}, n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\). Denote by \\(\\mathcal{D}_{e}\\) the collection of all subsets \\(D\\in\\Omega\\) consisting of an even number of elements. Conditions 1, 2, and 3 above are satisfied, and hence \\(\\mathcal{D}_{e}\\) is a D-system. However, if \\(n&lt;1\\) and we take \\(A=\\{\\omega_{1}, \\omega_{2}\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{\\omega_{2}, \\omega_{3}\\}\\), we see that \\(A\\in\\mathcal{D}_{e}, B\\in \\mathcal{D}_{e}\\) and \\(A\\cap B =\\{\\omega_{2}\\}\\notin \\mathcal{D}_{e}\\). Thus \\(\\mathcal{D}_{e}\\) is not even a field and hence not a \\(\\sigma\\)-field. Note that a D-system \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) is a \\(\\sigma\\)-field if and only if the intersection of any two sets in \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) is again in \\(\\mathcal{D}\\). Example 2.6 (Trivial and total sigma-fields) For any sample space \\(\\Omega\\), the smallest and largest \\(\\sigma\\)-fields are the trivial \\(\\sigma\\)-field \\(2^{\\Omega}=\\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\}\\) and the total \\(\\sigma\\)-field (also called the power \\(\\sigma\\)-field) \\((\\Omega)=\\{ \\text{all subsets of } \\Omega \\}\\), respectively. Remember that we are allowed to determine only whether or not event \\(A\\) occured for \\(A\\in \\mathcal{F}\\), not for sets outside \\(\\mathcal{F}\\). The trivial \\(\\sigma\\)-field is not very useful because the only events that we are allowed to consider are the entire sample space and the empty set. In other words, we can determine only whether something or nothing happened. With the total \\(\\sigma\\)-field we can determine, for each subset \\(A\\subset \\Omega\\), whether or not event \\(A\\) occurred. The trouble with \\(2^{\\Omega}\\) is that it may be too large to ensure that the properties we desire for a probability measure hold for all \\(A\\in\\mathcal{F}\\). Therefore, we want \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) to be large, but not too large. Example 2.7 (For countable sample sapce, the sigma-field should be the total sigma-field) Suppose \\(\\Omega\\) is a countable set like \\(\\{0,1,2,\\ldots, \\}\\). We certainly want \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) to contain each singleton. But any \\(\\sigma\\)-field that contains each singleton \\(\\omega\\) must contain all subsets of \\(\\Omega\\). This follows from the fact that any subset \\(A\\) of \\(\\Omega\\) is a countable union \\(\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\{\\omega_{i}\\}\\) of singletons, and \\(\\sigma\\)-fields are closed under countable unions. Therefore, when the sample space is countable, we should always use the total \\(\\sigma\\)-field. Example 2.8 (The union of a sequence of sigma-fields need not be a sigma-field) Let \\(\\mathcal{F}_{1},\\mathcal{F}_{2}, \\ldots\\) be a sequence of \\(\\sigma\\)-fields of subsets of the set \\(\\Omega\\). Then their intersection \\(\\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\mathcal{F}_{n}\\) is always a \\(\\sigma\\)-field and it is natural to ask whether the union \\(\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\mathcal{F}_{n}\\) is a \\(\\sigma\\)-field. We shall now show that the answer to this question is negative. Consider the set \\(\\Omega=\\{\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2},\\omega_{3}\\}\\) and the following two classes of its subsets: \\(\\mathcal{F}_{1}=\\{\\emptyset, \\{\\omega_{1}\\}, \\{\\omega_{2},\\omega_{3}\\}, \\Omega \\}\\), \\(\\mathcal{F}_{2}=\\{\\emptyset, \\{\\omega_{2}\\}, \\{\\omega_{1},\\omega_{3}\\}, \\Omega \\}.\\) Then \\(\\mathcal{F}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{F}_{2}\\) are fields and hence \\(\\sigma\\)-fields. Obviously the intersection \\(\\mathcal{F}_{1}\\cap \\mathcal{F}_{2} =\\{ \\emptyset, \\Omega \\}\\), the trivial \\(\\sigma\\)-field. However, the union \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathcal{F}&amp;=\\mathcal{F}_{1} \\cup \\mathcal{F}_{2}\\\\ &amp;= \\{\\emptyset, \\{\\omega_{1}\\}, \\{\\omega_{2}\\}, \\{\\omega_{2},\\omega_{3} \\}, \\{\\omega_{1},\\omega_{3} \\},\\Omega \\}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\] is not a field, and hence not a \\(\\sigma\\)-field because the element \\(\\{\\omega_{1}\\}\\cup \\{\\omega_{2}\\}=\\{\\omega_{1},\\omega_{2}\\}\\notin\\mathcal{F}\\).

["3-3-sigma-fields-in-real-line.html", "3.3 Sigma-fields in real line", " 3.3 Sigma-fields in real line We next consider \\(\\sigma\\)-fields when \\(\\Omega\\) is the uncountable set \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) (or an interval). Again, any useful \\(\\sigma\\)-field must contain each singleton \\(\\omega\\). Definition 2.6 (Co-finite and co-countable) The set \\(A\\in\\Omega\\) is called co-finite set if its complement \\(A^C\\) is finnite. Further, the set \\(A\\in\\Omega\\) is called a co-countable set if \\(A^C\\) is countable. Let \\(\\mathcal{F}_{1}\\) consist of the finite and co-finite subsets of \\(\\Omega\\). Then, \\(\\mathcal{F}_{1}\\) is a field. It is a \\(\\sigma\\)-field if and only if \\(\\Omega\\) is finite. Let \\(\\mathcal{F}_{2}\\) consist of the countable and the co-countable subsets of \\(\\Omega\\). Then it is easy to check that \\(\\mathcal{F}_{2}\\) is a \\(\\sigma\\)-field. Exercise 2.1 Prove that the collection of countable and co-countable sets is itself a \\(\\sigma\\)-field. Example 2.9 (A sigma-field of subsets of sample space need not contain all subsets of sample space) Suppose that \\(\\Omega\\) is uncountable. Then \\(\\Omega\\) contains a subset \\(A\\) such that \\(A\\) and \\(A^C\\) are both uncountable. This show that in general a \\(\\sigma\\)-field of \\(\\Omega\\) need not contain all subsets of \\(\\Omega\\) and need not be closed under the formation of arbitrary uncountable unions. Example 2.10 (Sigma-field of countable and co-countable sets: too small) Suppose that \\(\\Omega\\) is uncountable set like \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) or \\([0,1]\\). If we want \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) to include each singleton \\(\\omega\\), then \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) must contain each countable subset \\(A\\). It must also contain the complement of each countable set. Therefore, any \\(\\sigma\\)-field containing the singletons must contain all countable and co-countable sets. Unfortunately, this \\(\\sigma\\)-field is not large enough to be useful. For instance, if \\(\\Omeag=[0,1]\\), then we are not allowed to consider events like \\([0,\\frac{1}{2}]\\) because it is neither countable nor co-countable. "],
