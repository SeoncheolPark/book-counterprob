You can use anything that Pandocâ€™s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/. "],
["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!

["classes-of-random-events.html", "Chapter 3 Classes of Random Events", " Chapter 3 Classes of Random Events Let \\(\\Omega\\) (the sample space of all possible outcomes of an experiments) be an arbitrary non-empty set. Its elements, denoted by \\(\\omega\\), will be interpreted as outcomes (results) of some experiment. As usual, we use \\(A \\cup B\\) and \\(A \\cap B\\) to represent the union and the intersection of any two subsets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) of \\(\\Omega\\), respectively. Also, \\(A^c\\) is the complement of \\(A\\subset \\Omega\\). In particular, \\(\\Omega^c=\\theta\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is the empty set. Definition 3.1 (Field) The class \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) of subsets of \\(\\Omega\\) is called a field if it contains \\(\\Omega\\) and is closed under the formation of complements and finite unions, that is if: \\(\\Omega \\in \\mathcal{A}\\); \\(A \\in \\mathcal{A} \\Rightarrow A^c \\in \\mathcal{A}\\); \\(A_{1}, A_{2}\\in\\mathcal{A} \\Rightarrow A_{1} \\cup A_{2} \\in \\mathcal{A}\\). Proposition 3.1 (Definition of a field) The condition 3 of the definition of a field can be replaced by \\(A_{1}, A_{2} \\in \\mathcal{A} \\Rightarrow A_{1} \\cap A_{2} \\in \\mathcal{A}\\). That means, \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is closed under finite intersections. Proof. By de Morgan laws, \\((A_{1} \\cap A_{2})^{c} = A_{1}^{c} \\cup A_{2}^{c}\\) and \\((A_{1} \\cup A_{2})^{c} = A_{1}^{c} \\cap A_{2}^{c}\\). By the condition 2 of the definition of a field, we can get the desired result. Definition 3.2 (Signa-field) The class \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) of subsets of \\(\\Omega\\) is called a \\(\\sigma\\)-field if it is a field and closed under the formation of countable unions, that is if: \\(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, \\in \\mathcal{F} \\Rightarrow \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty}A_{n} \\in \\mathcal{F}\\). Proposition 3.2 (Definition of a sigma-field) The condition 4 of the definition of a sigma-field can be replaced by \\(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, \\in \\mathcal{F} \\Rightarrow \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty}A_{n} \\in \\mathcal{F}\\). That means, \\(\\sigma\\)-field \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is closed under countable intersections. Proof. By de Morgan lawsand condition 2 of the definition of a field, \\((\\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty}A_{n})^{c}=\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty}A_{n}^{c}\\in\\mathcal{F}\\) and \\((\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty}A_{n})^{c}=\\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty}A_{n}^{c}\\in\\mathcal{F}\\). So, we can change the condition 4. Usually, \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is the set of events (subsets of \\(\\Omega\\)) we are allowed to consider. Definition 3.3 (Random events (events)) The elements of any field of \\(\\sigma\\)-field are called random events (or simply, events). Example 3.1 (A class of events which is a field but not a sigma-field) Let \\(\\Omega = [0, \\infty)\\) and \\(\\mathcal{F}_{1}\\) be the class of all intervals of the type \\([a,b)\\) or \\([a,\\infty)\\), where \\(0 \\leq a &lt; b &lt; \\infty\\). Let \\(\\mathcal{F}_{2}\\) be the class of all finite sums of intervals of \\(\\mathcal{F}_{1}\\). Then \\(\\mathcal{F}_{1}\\) is not a field, and \\(\\mathcal{F}_{2}\\) is a field but not a \\(\\sigma\\)-field. "],
