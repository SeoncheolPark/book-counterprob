This is a \emph{sample} book written in \textbf{Markdown}. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\).

The \textbf{bookdown} package can be installed from CRAN or Github:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"bookdown"}\NormalTok{)}
\CommentTok{# or the development version}
\CommentTok{# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading \texttt{\#}.

To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): \url{https://yihui.name/tinytex/}.

\hypertarget{intro}{%
\chapter{Introduction}\label{intro}}

You can label chapter and section titles using \texttt{\{\#label\}} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \ref{intro}. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \ref{methods}.

Figures and tables with captions will be placed in \texttt{figure} and \texttt{table} environments, respectively.

\section{Sample space and Event}\label{sample-space-and-event}}

Let \(\Omega\) (the \textbf{sample space} of all possible outcomes of an experiments) be an arbitrary non-empty set. Its elements, denoted by \(\omega\), will be interpreted as \textbf{outcomes (results)} of some experiment. These outcomes sometimes called \textbf{simple events} or \textbf{elements} becaus they cannot be decomposed further. Other events (subsets of \(\Omega\)) are \textbf{compound events} because they are composed of two or more simple events. An \textbf{event} \(A\) occurs if and only if the randomly selected \(\omega\) belongs to \(A\). As usual, we use \(A \cup B\) and \(A \cap B\) to represent the union and the intersection of any two subsets \(A\) and \(B\) of \(\Omega\), respectively. Also, \(A^c\) is the complement of \(A\subset \Omega\). In particular, \(\Omega^c=\theta\), where \(\theta\) is the empty set.

\BeginKnitrBlock{definition}[Semi-field]
\protect\hypertarget{def:unnamed-chunk-9}{}{\label{def:unnamed-chunk-9} \iffalse (Semi-field) \fi{} }Let \(\Omega\) be an arbitrary set. A non-empty class \(\mathcal{J}\) of subsets of \(\Omega\) is called a \textbf{semi-field} if \(\Omega = \mathcal{J}, \emptyset \in \mathcal{J}\), \(\mathcal{J}\) is closed under the formation of finite intersections, and the complement of any set in \(\mathcal{J}\) is a finite sum of disjoint sets of \(\mathcal{J}\).
\EndKnitrBlock{definition}

It is easy to see that any field of subsets of \(\Omega\) is also a semi-field. However, the following simple examples show that the converse is not true.

\BeginKnitrBlock{example}[A class of events which is a semi-field but not a field]
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unnamed-chunk-10}{}{\label{exm:unnamed-chunk-10} \iffalse (A class of events which is a semi-field but not a field) \fi{} }1. Let \(\Omega=[-\infty, \infty)\) and \(\mathcal{J}_{1}\), contain \(\Omega\), \(\{\infty\}\) and all intervals of the type \([a,b)\) where \(-\infty < a \leq b \leq \infty\). Then, \(\emptyset \in \mathcal{J}_{1}\), \(\Omega \in \mathcal{J}_{1}\), \([a_{1}, b_{1}) \cap [a_{2}, b_{2})=[a_{1} \vee a_{2}, b_{1} \wedge b_{2})\in\mathcal{J}_{1}\), and \([a,b)^{C}=[-\infty, a)\cup[b, \infty)\). So, \(\mathcal{J}_{1}\), is a semi-field. Obviously \(\mathcal{J}_{1}\) is not a field (Check \ref{exm:efnsf}).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Take \(\Omega = \mathbb{R}^{1}\) and denote by \(\mathcal{J}_{2}\) the class of all subsets of the form \(A\cap B\) where \(A\) is closed and \(B\) is an open set in \(\Omega\). Then again, \(\mathcal{J}_{2}\) is a semi-field but not a field.
\end{enumerate}

\BeginKnitrBlock{definition}[Sigma-field]
\protect\hypertarget{def:unnamed-chunk-11}{}{\label{def:unnamed-chunk-11} \iffalse (Sigma-field) \fi{} }The class \(\mathcal{F}\) of subsets of \(\Omega\) is called a \(\sigma\)\textbf{-field} if it is a field and closed under the formation of countable unions, that is if:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  \(A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, \in \mathcal{F} \Rightarrow \cup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n} \in \mathcal{F}\).
\end{enumerate}
\EndKnitrBlock{definition}

\BeginKnitrBlock{proposition}[Definition of a sigma-field]
\protect\hypertarget{prp:sigmafield}{}{\label{prp:sigmafield} \iffalse (Definition of a sigma-field) \fi{} }The condition 4 of the definition of a sigma-field can be replaced by

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  \(A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, \in \mathcal{F} \Rightarrow \cap_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n} \in \mathcal{F}\).
\end{enumerate}

That means, \(\sigma\)-field \(\mathcal{F}\) is closed under countable intersections because \(\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n} = (\cup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n}^{C})^{C}\) and each \(A_{n}^{C}\) belongs to \(\mathcal{F}\).
\EndKnitrBlock{proposition}

\BeginKnitrBlock{proof}
\iffalse{} {Proof. } \fi{}By de Morgan laws and condition 2 of the definition of a field, \((\cap_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n})^{C}=\cup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n}^{C}\in\mathcal{F}\) and \((\cup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n})^{C}=\cap_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n}^{C}\in\mathcal{F}\). So, we can change the condition 4.
\EndKnitrBlock{proof}

Usually, \(\mathcal{F}\) is the set of events (subsets of \(\Omega\)) we are allowed to consider.

\BeginKnitrBlock{definition}[Random events (events)]
\protect\hypertarget{def:unnamed-chunk-13}{}{\label{def:unnamed-chunk-13} \iffalse (Random events (events)) \fi{} }The elements of any field of \(\sigma\)-field are called \textbf{random events} (or simply, \textbf{events}).
\EndKnitrBlock{definition}

\BeginKnitrBlock{example}[A class of events which is a field but not a sigma-field]
\protect\hypertarget{exm:efnsf}{}{\label{exm:efnsf} \iffalse (A class of events which is a field but not a sigma-field) \fi{} }Let \(\Omega = [0, \infty)\) and \(\mathcal{F}_{1}\) be the class of all intervals of the type \([a,b)\) or \([a,\infty)\), where \(0 \leq a < b < \infty\). Let \(\mathcal{F}_{2}\) be the class of all finite sums of intervals of \(\mathcal{F}_{1}\). Then \(\mathcal{F}_{1}\) is not a field, and \(\mathcal{F}_{2}\) is a field but not a \(\sigma\)-field.

Take arbitrary numbers \(a\) and \(b\), \(0<a<b<\infty\). Then \(A=[a,b)\in \mathcal{F}_{1}\). However, \(A^{C} = [0, a) \cup [b, \infty)\neq \mathcal{F}_{1}\) and thus \(\mathcal{F}_{1}\) is not a field.

It is easy to see that

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  the finite union of finite sums of intervals (of \(\mathcal{F}_{1}\)) is again a sum of intervals;
\item
  the complement of a finite sum of intervals is also a sum of intervals. This means that \(\mathcal{F}_{2}\) is a field.
\end{enumerate}

However, \(\mathcal{F}_{2}\) is not a \(\sigma\)-field because, for example, the set \(A_{n} =[0,\frac{1}{n})\in\mathcal{F}_{1}\) for each \(n=1,2,\ldots,\) and the intersection \(\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n} =\{0\}\) does not belong to \(\mathcal{F}_{1}\).

Let us look at two additional cases.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Let \(\Omega = \mathbb{R}^{1}\) and \(\mathcal{F}\) be the class of all finite sums of intervals of the type \$(-\infty, a{]}, \((b,c]\) and \((d,\infty)\). Then \(\mathcal{F}\) is a field. But the intersection \(\cap_{n=1}^{\infty}(b-\frac{1}{n}, c]\) is equal to \([b,c]\) which does not belong to \(\mathcal{F}\). Hence, the field \(\mathcal{F}\) is not a \(\sigma\)-field.
\item
  Let \(\Omega\) be any infinite set and \(\mathcal{A}\) the collection of all subsets \(A\in \Omega\) such that either \(A\) or \(A^{c}\) is finite. Then it is easy to see that \(\mathcal{A}\) is a field but not a \(\sigma\)-field.
\end{enumerate}
\EndKnitrBlock{example}

\BeginKnitrBlock{example}[A class of events can be closed under finite unions and finite intersections but not under complements]
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unnamed-chunk-14}{}{\label{exm:unnamed-chunk-14} \iffalse (A class of events can be closed under finite unions and finite intersections but not under complements) \fi{} }Let \(\Omega = \mathbb{R}\) and the class \(\mathcal{A}\) consist of intervals of the type \((x,\infty)\), \(x\in\Omega\). Then using the notations \(u = x\wedge y:= \min\{x,y\}\) and \(v=x\vee y:=\max \{x,y\}\) we have:
\[(x,\infty) \cup (y,\infty) = (u,\infty)\in\mathcal{A}\]
\[(x,\infty) \cap (y,\infty) = (v,\infty)\in\mathcal{A}.\]
However, \((x,\infty)^{C} = (-\infty, x]\notin\mathcal{A}\).
\EndKnitrBlock{example}

\BeginKnitrBlock{remark}
\iffalse{} {Remark. } \fi{}Because any field or \(\sigma\)-field \(\mathcal{F}\) is nonempty, it contains a set \(A\), and therefore \(A^{C}\). Consequently, any field or \(\sigma\)-field contains \(\Omega = A \cup A^{C}\) and \(\emptyset = \Omega^{C}\).
\EndKnitrBlock{remark}

A \(\sigma\)-field is more restrictive than a field. Because we want to be able to consider countable unions, we require the allowable sets \(\mathcal{F}\) to be a \(\sigma\)-field. Therefore, it is understood in probability theory and throughout the remainder we are allowed to consider only the events belonging to the \(\sigma\)-field \(\mathcal{F}\). We will see that fields also play an important role in probability because a common technique is first to define a probability measure on a field and then extend it to a \(\sigma\)-field.

\BeginKnitrBlock{definition}[D-system]
\protect\hypertarget{def:unnamed-chunk-16}{}{\label{def:unnamed-chunk-16} \iffalse (D-system) \fi{} }A system \(\mathcal{D}\) of subsets of a given set \(\Omega\) is called a \textbf{D-system} (Dynkin system) in \(\Omega\) if the following three conditions hold:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \(\Omega \in \mathcal{D}\);
\item
  \(A,B\in \mathcal{D}\) and \(A\subset B \Rightarrow B\backslash A\in\mathcal{D}\);
\item
  \(A_{n}\in \mathcal{D}, n=1,2,\ldots .\) and \(A_{1} \subset A_{2} \subset \ldots \Rightarrow \cup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n} \in \mathcal{D}\).
\end{enumerate}
\EndKnitrBlock{definition}

It is obvious that every \(\sigma\)-field is a D-system, but the converse may not be true.

\BeginKnitrBlock{example}[Every sigma-field of events is a D-system, but the converse does not always hold]
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unnamed-chunk-17}{}{\label{exm:unnamed-chunk-17} \iffalse (Every sigma-field of events is a D-system, but the converse does not always hold) \fi{} }Take \(\Omega = \{\omega_{1}, \omega_{2}, \ldots, \omega_{2n}\}, n\in\mathbb{N}\). Denote by \(\mathcal{D}_{e}\) the collection of all subsets \(D\in\Omega\) consisting of an even number of elements. Conditions 1, 2, and 3 above are satisfied, and hence \(\mathcal{D}_{e}\) is a D-system. However, if \(n<1\) and we take \(A=\{\omega_{1}, \omega_{2}\}\) and \(B=\{\omega_{2}, \omega_{3}\}\), we see that \(A\in\mathcal{D}_{e}, B\in \mathcal{D}_{e}\) and \(A\cap B =\{\omega_{2}\}\notin \mathcal{D}_{e}\). Thus \(\mathcal{D}_{e}\) is not even a field and hence not a \(\sigma\)-field.
\EndKnitrBlock{example}

Remember that we are allowed to determine only whether or not event \(A\) occured for \(A\in \mathcal{F}\), not for sets outside \(\mathcal{F}\). The trivial \(\sigma\)-field is not very useful because the only events that we are allowed to consider are the entire sample space and the empty set. In other words, we can determine only whether something or nothing happened. With the total \(\sigma\)-field we can determine, for each subset \(A\subset \Omega\), whether or not event \(A\) occurred. The trouble with \(2^{\Omega}\) is that it may be too large to ensure that the properties we desire for a probability measure hold for all \(A\in\mathcal{F}\).

Therefore, we want \(\mathcal{F}\) to be large, but not too large.

Consider the set \(\Omega=\{\omega_{1},\omega_{2},\omega_{3}\}\) and the following two classes of its subsets: \(\mathcal{F}_{1}=\{\emptyset, \{\omega_{1}\}, \{\omega_{2},\omega_{3}\}, \Omega \}\), \(\mathcal{F}_{2}=\{\emptyset, \{\omega_{2}\}, \{\omega_{1},\omega_{3}\}, \Omega \}.\) Then \(\mathcal{F}_{1}\) and \(\mathcal{F}_{2}\) are fields and hence \(\sigma\)-fields.

The definition of the Borel \(\sigma\)-field is somewhat dissatisfying because it is hard to picture the intersection of all \(\sigma\)-fields containing the intervals. It would be more pleasing if we could begin with the intervals \(\mathcal{I}_1\), throw in all complements and countable unions of sets in \(\mathcal{I}_{1}\) to create \(\mathcal{I}_{2}\), then throw in all complements and countable unions of sets in \(\mathcal{I}_{2}\) to create \(\mathcal{I}_{3}\), etc. It would still be difficult to picture all of the sets, but at least we could imagine how to construct them. Unfortunately, this process must be continued indefinitely. In fact, even \(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}\mathcal{I}_{i}\) does not produce all of the Borel sets. \citep{Billingsley2012}

It is actually difficult to construct a set that is \textbf{not a Borel set}. Nevertheless, we will see later that an even larger \(\sigma\)-field, called the \textbf{Lebesgue sets}, is also useful in probability and measure theory.

It is sometimes helpful to consider the events \(\{-\infty\}\) or \(\{+\infty\}\). These sets are not in the Borel \(\sigma\)-field because they are not subsets of \(\mathbb{R} = (-\infty, \infty)\).

IF \(\{A_n\}\in\mathcal{F}\), we can define other events involving the \(A_{n}\). We have seen, for example, that \(B=\cup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n}\) is the event that at least one \(A_n\) occurs, while \(C=\cap_{n=1}^{\infty}A_n\) is the event that all of the \(A_n\) occur. Sometimes there is interest in seeing whether \(A_n\) occurs for infinitely many \(n\). For instance, in a coin-flipping experiment, let \(A_n\) denote the event that the \(n\)-th coin flip is heads. We might be interested in whether infinitely many flips are heads. We now show that for general \(A_1, A_2,\ldots,\) the event that \(A_n\) occurs for infinitely many \(n\) is a honest (bona fide) event in the sense that it is in \(\mathcal{F}\). Note that \(\omega \in A_{n}\) for infinitely many \(n\) if and only if no matter how large \(N\) i, \(\omega\in \cap_{N=1}^{\infty}\cup_{n\geq N}A_{n} =\cap_{N=1}^{\infty} B_{N}\), where \(B_{N} =\cup_{n\geq N } A_{n}\). Because \(B_N\) is a countalbe union of \(\mathcal{F}\)-sets, \(B_N\in\mathcal{F}\). This being true for each \(N\), \(\cap_{N=1}^{\infty} B_{N} \in\mathcal{F}\) because \(\mathcal{F}\) is closed under countable intersections. (refer to Prop \ref{prp:sigmafield}) Therefore, the event that \(A_n\) occurs for infinitely many \(n\) is in \(\mathcal{F}\). We denote this event by \(\{A_n \text{ i.o}\}\), which stands for \(A_n\) occurs infinitely often (in \(n\)).

This expression can also be deduced from general principles because if \(\omega\) is in only finitely many of the \(A_n\), then there must be an \(N\) for which \(\omega\) is not in \(A_{n}\) for any \(n\geq N\). That is, \(\omega\) must be in \(A_{n}^{C}\) for all \(n\geq N\). This must occur for at least on \(N\), which translates into a union.

A probability measure \(P\) is a function that assigns a probability to the allowable sets \(\mathcal{F}\) and that satisfies certain conditions. Ideally, we would like \(P\) to satisfiy \(P(\Omega)=1\) and \(P(\cup_{t}A_t)=\sum_{t}P(A_t)\) for every collection of disjoint sets \(A_t\), even an uncountable collection. Unfortunately, this \textbf{uncountable additivity} requirement is too much to ask because it precludes the existence of a ``uniform'' probability measure \(P\) on \(\Omega=[0,1]\). To see this, note that for such a measure, each \(\omega=\Omega\) has the same probability \(p\), so if \(P\) were uncountably additive, then \(1=P(\Omega)=P([0,1])=\sum_{\Omega}p\). But this produces a contradiction because \(\sum_{\Omega}p\) is \(0\) if \(p=0\) and \(\infty\) if \(p>0\). Therefore, uncountable additivity is too strong a condition to require. It turns out the strongest property of this type that we con impose is \textbf{countable additivity}.

The term outer measure stems from the fact that we are approximating the measure of \(A\) from the outside, meaning that we consider the measure of a collection of sets that cover \(A\). It is easy to see that \(\mu^{*}\) agrees with \(\mu\) if \(A\) is an interval. But \(\mu^{*}\) is not necessarily countably additive on \textbf{all sets}, so the next step is:
\item
  Restrict the class of sets to \(\mathcal{L}=\{L : \mu^{*}(A)=\mu^{*}(L\cap A)+\mu^{*}(L^{C}\cap A)\) for every set \(A \}\). The collection \(\mathcal{L}\), called Lebesgue sets, is then shown to be a \(\sigma\)-field containing all Borel sets.

\BeginKnitrBlock{proof}
\iffalse{} {Proof. } \fi{}To see part 1, note that any event \(E\) may be written as the disjoint union \(E\cup \emptyset\). By countable additivity, \(P(E)=P(E)+P(\emptyset)\), from which it follows that \(P(\emptyset)=0\).

To see part 5, note that \(E_1 \cup E_2 = E_1 \cup (E_2 \backslash E_1)\). Because \(E_1\) and \(E_2 \backslash E_1\) are disjoint,
\[P(E_1\cup E_2)=P(E_1) +P(E_2\backslash E_1).\]
Also, \(E_2\) is the union of the disjoint sets \(E_1 \cap E_2\) and \(E_2\backslash E_1\), so \(P(E_1\cap E_2) +P(E_2\backslash E_1)=P(E_2)\). Thus, \(P(E_2\backslash E_1) = P(E_2) - P(E_1\cap E_2)\). Substituting this expression into the above equation gives \(P(E_1\cup E_2) = P(E_1) + P(E_2) - P(E_1\cap E_2)\).
\EndKnitrBlock{proof}

The following result that any countable union can be written as a countable union of disjoint sets is extremely useful in probability theory.

\BeginKnitrBlock{proposition}[Any countable union can be written as a countable union of disjoint sets]
\protect\hypertarget{prp:countabledisjointunion}{}{\label{prp:countabledisjointunion} \iffalse (Any countable union can be written as a countable union of disjoint sets) \fi{} }Let \(E_1, E_2, \ldots \in\mathcal{F}\) and define \(D_1 = E_1, D_2 = E_2\backslash E_1, D_3=E_3\backslash (E_1 \cup E_2), \ldots\) Then \(\{D_i\}\) is a collection of disjoint sets and \(\cup_{i=1}^{n}E_i = \cup_{i=1}^{n}D_{i}\) for \(n\) any positive integer or \(+\infty\).
\EndKnitrBlock{proposition}

\BeginKnitrBlock{proof}
\iffalse{} {Proof. } \fi{}It is clear that the \(D_i\) defined above are disjoint. We will prove that each \(\omega\in\cup_{i=1}^{n}E_{i}\) is in \(\cup_{i=1}^{n}D_{i}\) and vice versa. Note that each step in the following proof is valid whether \(n\) is a positive integer or \(+\infty\). If \(\omega \in \cup_{i=1}^{n}E_{i}\), then \(\omega \in E_i\) for some finite \(i\leq n\). Let \(I\) be the smallest \(i\leq n\) for which \(\omega \in E_i\). Then by definition, \(\omega \in E_t\) but not in any of the previous \(E_i\). That is, \(\omega \in D_I\), so \(\omega \in \cup_{i=1}^n D_{i}\). Thus, if \(\omega \in \cup_{i=1}^{n} E_{i}\), then \(\omega \in \cup_{i=1}^{n} D_{i}\).

To prove the converse, note that if \(\omega \in \cup_{i=1}^n D_i\), then \(\omega \in D_i\) for some finite \(i\leq n\). But then \(\omega \in E_i\), and hence \(\omega \in \cup_{i=1}^{n}E_i\). We have shown that each \(\omega \in \cup_{i=1}^n E_{i}\) is in \(\cup_{i=1}^{n}D_{i}\) and vice versa, and therefore \(\cup_{i=1}^{n}E_{i} = \cup_{i=1}^{n}D_{i}.\)

One consequence of Proposition \ref{prp:countabledisjointunion} is the following, which is called \textbf{countable subadditivity}. Ii is also called Boole's inequality, or, when there are only finitely many sets, Bonferroni's ineqaulity.

\BeginKnitrBlock{proposition}[Countable subadditivity (also called Boole's or Bonferroni's inequality]
\protect\hypertarget{prp:countablesubadditivity}{}{\label{prp:countablesubadditivity} \iffalse (Countable subadditivity (also called Boole's or Bonferroni's inequality) \fi{} }If \(E_1, E_2, \ldots\) are any sets (not necessarily disjoint), then \(P(\cup_i E_i) \leq \sum_{i} P(E_i)\).
\EndKnitrBlock{proposition}

\EndKnitrBlock{exercise}

The importance of Proposition \ref{prp:countablesubadditivity} in probability and statistics cannot be overstated.

Another consequence of Proposition \ref{prp:countabledisjointunion} is a certain continuity property of probability, namely that if a sequence of sets \(E_1, E_2, \ldots\) ``gets closer and closer'' to a set \(E\), then the probability of \(E_i\) also gets ``closer and closer'' to the probability of \(E\). But what does it mean for a sequence of sets \((E_i)_{i=1}^{\infty}\) to ge ``closer and closer'' to \(E\)?

\BeginKnitrBlock{definition}[Increasing and decreasing sets]
\protect\hypertarget{def:increasingdecreasingsets}{}{\label{def:increasingdecreasingsets} \iffalse (Increasing and decreasing sets) \fi{} }We say that a sequence of sets \((E_i)_{i=1}^{\infty}\) increase to \(E\)\textless{} written \(E_i \uparrow E\), if \(E_1 \subset E_2 \subset E_3 \subset \ldots\) and \(\cup_{i=1}^{\infty}E_{i} = E\). Similarily, \((E_i)_{i=1}^{\infty}\) decreases to \(E\), written \(E_i \downarrow E\), if \(E_1 \supset E_2 \supset E_3 \supset \ldots\) and \(\cap_{i=1}^{\infty}E_i = E\).
\EndKnitrBlock{definition}

For example, \(E_i=(-\infty, i]\uparrow E = (-\infty, \infty)\) and \(E_i = (-\infty, x+\frac{1}{i})\downarrow E = (-\infty, x]\) (see Figure \ref{fig:increasedecreasesetfig}).
